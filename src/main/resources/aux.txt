That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet.
Ensign Babyface!
You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data.
Your head is not an artifact!
You enjoyed that.
Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately?
This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I guess it's better to be lucky than good.
I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. We know you're dealing in stolen ore.
But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf.
I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer.
And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew.
But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf.
The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. We could cause a diplomatic crisis.
Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Talk about going nowhere fast. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship.
Your shields were failing, sir. We have a saboteur aboard. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others.
The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves?
